## Description
Our groups project is a website that shows graphic novels as books. Each book is a clickable item that displays all images from the particular book selected. If the user chooses to click on an image from related book it will show in a modal window with the approprieate tags for that selected image. Last, the user can click on an individual tag and all images with that tag name will display.
